  description: "This module enables a privileged user to specify the important part of an image for the purposes of cropping.   The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize certain form element attributes when the focal point widget is displayed on a form.   This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to generate markup (e.g. with a field that accepts filtered html) AND they must have permission to edit a node or entity whose add/edit form contains the focal point widget."
