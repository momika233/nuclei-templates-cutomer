# Nuclei + Wordfence = â™¥

This project provides a massive up-to-date collection of Nuclei templates that can be used to scan for vulnerabilities in WordPress. The templates are based on the vulnerability reports of Wordfence.com.

This project is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to scan for vulnerabilities in WordPress-based websites. The templates are easy to use and up-to-date, and they are open source so you can modify them to fit your specific needs. If you are responsible for the security of a website that uses WordPress, I highly recommend using this project to scan for vulnerabilities.

__If you found this project helpful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub. Your support helps to make this project even better.__

## Features

* The templates are easy to use and can be run with a single command.
* The templates are based on the vulnerability reports of Wordfence.com.
* The templates are updated regularly to ensure that they are always up-to-date with the latest vulnerabilities.
* The templates are open source, so you can modify them to fit your specific needs.
